<h2>My name is Tyler Slaugh and I am originally from the Bay Area. I am a 20 year old college student at The New School. My passion for writing really began a couple of years ago. The articles that I have shared on this website were all produced for The New School Free Press, our school paper. I've learned a lot about my personal writing voice and style while writing for The Free Press this year. Most of my work includes features on arts and culture. I am eager to grow as a writer so that one day it turns into a real career. My main interests include fashion, art, trends, and pop culture. I hope you enjoy the pieces I have included!</h2>
